# Hospital Insurance Claims EDA

This project explores a synthetic health insurance claims dataset to identify patterns in provider behavior, patient demographics, and claim submissions. The goal is to demonstrate exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills relevant to roles in healthcare and insurance analytics.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Synthetic Health Insurance Claims Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leandrenash/enhanced-health-insurance-claims-dataset)
- **Description**: The dataset includes 4,500 records with information on patients, providers, procedure and diagnosis codes, claim amounts, statuses, and submission methods.

## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to simulate the kind of insights and workflows a claims analyst or healthcare data analyst might perform when reviewing medical claim submissions. While the data is synthetic and largely uniform (leading to evenly distributed values), it serves as a strong base for showcasing key data exploration and visualization techniques.

## What the Project Covers

- Provider profiling: identifying high-charging and high-volume providers
- Suspicious behavior detection based on procedure frequency and specialty
- Patient demographic trends by provider type
- Claim submission methods and approval trends
- Grouped bar plots, swarm/strip plots, and summary statistics

## Note

Since the dataset is synthetic, the results should not be interpreted as realistic or representative of actual fraud or billing behavior. The focus is on the **analysis approach**, **code quality**, and **communication of findings**.
